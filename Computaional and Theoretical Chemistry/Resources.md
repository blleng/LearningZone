## Lecture Notes

### MIT Physical Chemistry

#### Physical Chemistry I

Instructed by Robert Guy Griffin and Troy Van Voorhis.

> This course presents an introduction to quantum mechanics. It begins with an examination of the historical development of quantum theory, properties of particles and waves, wave mechanics and applications to simple systems — the particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, the rigid rotor and the hydrogen atom. The lectures continue with a discussion of atomic structure and the Periodic Table. The final lectures cover applications to chemical bonding including valence bond and molecular orbital theory, molecular structure, spectroscopy.

#### Physical Chemistry II

Instructed by Robert Field and Robert Guy Griffin.

> This course covers elementary statistical mechanics, transport properties, kinetic theory, solid state, reaction rate theory, and chemical reaction dynamics.

### MIT Quantum Mechanics

#### Quantum Mechanics I

Instructed by Robert Field.

> This course presents the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics: wave properties, uncertainty principles, the Schrödinger equation, and operator and matrix methods. Key topics include commutation rule definitions of scalar, vector, and spherical tensor operators; the Wigner-Eckart theorem; and 3j (Clebsch-Gordan) coefficients. In addition, we deal with many-body systems, exemplified by many-electron atoms (“electronic structure”), anharmonically coupled harmonic oscillators (“intramolecular vibrational redistribution: IVR”), and periodic solids.
